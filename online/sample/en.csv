The smell I sometimes notice at various places reminds me of this memory.

The memory is when I was only 1 year old baby, and I was playing with Plarail by my sleeping newborn sister.
The smell reminds me of the moment vividly. My mother's hair than, the black counter table and plants in the room, and etc.
Maybe there is a photo of this moment because the memory is from someone's perspective, not mine.

I still cannot figure out what this smell is, and how to explain how this small is like.
