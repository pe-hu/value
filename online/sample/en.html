The smell I sometimes notice at various places reminds me of this memory.<br/>
<br/>
The memory is when I was only 1 year old baby, and I was playing with Plarail by my sleeping newborn sister.<br/>
The smell reminds me of the moment vividly. My mother's hair than, the black counter table and plants in the room, and etc.<br/>
Maybe there is a photo of this moment because the memory is from someone's perspective, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
I still cannot figure out what this smell is, and how to explain how this small is like.
