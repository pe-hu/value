                I was trying hard to put a big parcel into the post but it was too big. An old woman talked to me from behind me saying “this one! this!” and she was showing me a garbage bag. <br/> I was confused and asked her what it means, she continued
                to show me a garbage bag and said “tear it off! Tear it straight!”.
                <br/>I finally noticed that she was suggesting me to use a garbage bag that is made of vinyl so that the parcel should be slip into the post! I tore her garbage bag off and wrap the parcel with it and she walked down. The parcel I was
                almost giving up went down smoothly into the post. I rode the bicycle immediately and search for the old woman. I found her and I thank her again and again but she said “sorry for interrupted you girl!” and she smiled.<br/>
                <br/> She was too elegant and it made me feel embarrassed that I thought  I wanted to help others someday. She was cool..<br/> I want to be kind to others like her and I don’t want to forget this feeling.
